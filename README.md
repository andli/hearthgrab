# hearthgrab
First working prototype - does not handle golden cards yet!

1. Turn off all UI scaling
2. Run cardprep.py once
3. Start Hearthstone, set it to windowed and 1440x900 and go to your collection
4. Run hearthgrab.py (do NOT overlap the HS window)
5. Go grab a cup of coffee for about 200 seconds
6. Profit?
