# hearthgrab
Second working prototype - mostly working!

1. Turn off all UI scaling (Display Settings --> "Change the size of text, apps..." --> 100%)
2. Start Hearthstone, set it to windowed and 1440x900 and go to your collection
3. Run hearthgrab.exe (do NOT overlap the HS window)
4. Gaze at the blazing speeeeeed
5. JSON profit (hearthgrab.txt)
